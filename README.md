ABNielsen.com 6502 Single Board Computer R1

This is a 6502-based complete single board computer intended to help during the global IC shortage. Why use new chips when you can reuse scrap?

Check out the (old) project on HackADay if you want to read more and see some pretty pictures :)

R1 will get its own separate project on HackADay - in celebration that I got rid of the Padauk MCU without increasing the chip count!

Build instructions:

1) Send gerber files from /hardware to your favorite board house
2) Build the project using assemble.sh - this will also try to burn the main ROM using Minipro. Dependencies: [CC65] (https://github.com/cc65/cc65) and a way to burn the ROM's.
3) Burn the ROMs. I use a TL866II Plus variant for the actual ROMs.
4) Source the IC's - the spirit of this project is to contribute as little as possible to the global IC shortage and get used chips locally or from Ebay/AliExpress/etc.
5) Solder away
6) For the PS/2-keyboard I use Ben Eater's (a.k.a. Dieter MÃ¼ller's) interface: https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/mjeilv/keyboard_interface_diagram/
7) Enjoy!

Optional:
Setup SSH keys with a Raspberry Pi, connect an nRF24L01+ compatible module to it and compile the wireless bootloader code in /software_linux
